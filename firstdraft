# A software package to generate rotational spectrum of molecules. (Astrochemistry, yay!)
# Presumptions : Molecule is a symmterical top and is in Electric and vibrational ground state, 
# so we only care about the transitions between rotational levels of that molecule. 

# What this code does: 
    # Inputs required: Temperature, Rotational constants (A,B or C), Jmax, Kmax

    #define the above terms

    #step 1: selection rules : make an array of allowed transitions

    #step 2: Calculates frequencies/wavenumbers : uppper level energy - lower level energy

        # 2.1 write code to calculate energies of different levels and find wavenumber out of it

    #step 3: calculate intensities : Honl-london factor * Boltzmann distribution
    
      # 3.1: Find Honl London (6 equations)
      # 3.2:  Boltzmann distribution (1 equation)
      # 3.3:  Intensity = Hl * BD
      
     #step 6: optional: Export linelist (J, K, wavenumber, int, Hl, Bd, etc)

    #step 4: Plot intensity vs. wavenumber
    
    #step 5: smooth the curve
