# A software package to generate rotational spectrum of molecules. (Astrochemistry, yay!)
# Presumptions : Molecule is a symmterical top and is in Electric and vibrational ground state, 
# so we only care about the transitions between rotational levels of that molecule. 

# What this code does: 
    # Inputs required: Temperature, Rotational constants (A,B or C), Jmax, Kmax

    #define the above terms

    #selection rules : make an array of allowed transitions

    # Calculates frequencies/wavenumbers : uppper level energy - lower level energy

        # write code to calculate energies of different levels and find wavenumber out of it

    # calculate intensities : Honl-london factor * Boltzmann distribution
